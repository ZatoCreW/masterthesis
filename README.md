## Problem Statement
Bicing is Barcelona's public cycling system, equipped with several parking lots and bikes in them to be used by subscribers of this service. One of the main issues with the service is getting to a parking lot without any available bicycles or trying to park in a lot without any free slots. I intend to predict in advance these situations which could be used to improve the service management
## Dataset
Both taken from Barcelona's open data portal:
- [Bicing stations](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset/bicing) 
- [Bicing usage](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset/us-del-servei-bicing)

Datasets contain records (5min spans) of bicycles currently being used in the city and slots and bicycles available in each of the parking lots.
