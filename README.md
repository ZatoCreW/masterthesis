## Problem Statement
Bicing is Barcelona's public cycling system, equipped with several parking lots and bikes in them to be used by subscribers of this service. One of the main issues with the service is getting to a parking lot without any available bicycles or trying to park in a lot without any free slots. I intend to predict in advance these situations which could be used to improve the service management. Ideally, I would like to solve this problem using Graph Neural Networks but simpler models will also be tried out.
## Dataset
Dataset:
- [Bicing stations](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset/bicing) 
- [Bicing usage](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset/us-del-servei-bicing) 

Datasets contains update records (every 5 minutes) of bicycles currently being used in the city and slots and bicycles availability in each of the parking lots.
